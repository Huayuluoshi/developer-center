Dear deepin OS User,​
​
deepin OS was developed in China with a global perspective. To enhance the localization experience of this Chinese Linux distribution for users around the world, we aim to make deepin OS accessible to the global community. We warmly invite more open-source enthusiasts and community organizations to join our localization efforts!​

Currently, deepin supports 55 languages, including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Tibetan, Uyghur, English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Albanian, Azerbaijani, Finnish, Dutch, Czech, Turkish, Catalan, Slovenian, Serbian, Arabic, Malay, Galician, Korean, Croatian, Danish, Romanian, Karelian, Klingon, Lithuanian, Indonesian, Slovak, Greek, Hindi, Kabyle, Japanese, Nepali, Persian, Estonian, Kazakh, Bulgarian, Swedish, Amharic, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Bengali, Thai, Uzbek, Filipino, and Urdu.​

We are committed to expanding our language support even further. If you find any inaccuracies in existing translations, please help us correct them to improve translation accuracy. Additionally, if you'd like to translate into a language that deepin does not currently support, we welcome your participation to help us build a more comprehensive, global language support system.​
